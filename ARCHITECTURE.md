# System Architecture

## Overview
Express API backed by MongoDB. Key domains are Admins, Facilities, QR Codes, Devices, and Enrollments (one active record per device, reused on re-entry). Daily QR rotation runs on a cron to refresh tokens and email facility contacts.

```
Mobile App ──▶ /api/enrollments (entry/exit/restore)
            │
            └──▶ /api/facilities/create-facility (public setup)

Admin UI / Tools ──▶ /api/auth/admin/login
                  └─▶ /api/admin/* (admins, facilities, devices)

MDM Service ──▶ utils/mdmService (lock/unlock + push restore)

MongoDB ──▶ Admin, Facility, QRCode, Device, Enrollment collections
```

## Request Flows
### Entry (lock camera)
1. App posts `token + deviceId + deviceInfo` to `/api/enrollments/scan-entry`.
2. Token is validated against QRCode (must be type `entry`).
3. Device record is created/updated; camera lock requested via `mdmService`.
4. Enrollment document is **reused or created once** for the device; status set to `active` and QR references updated.
5. Device status set to `active`, QR scan recorded, success returned.

### Exit (unlock camera)
1. App posts `token + deviceId` to `/api/enrollments/scan-exit`.
2. QR is validated (type `exit`).
3. Active enrollment is completed (`status=completed`, `unenrolledAt` set).
4. Device status set to `inactive`; camera unlock requested.

### Force Exit (admin)
1. Admin posts to `/api/admin/devices/:deviceId/force-exit` (or legacy `/api/enrollments/admin/force-exit`).
2. Active enrollment is marked `forced_exit`; device unlocked; optional restore push token sent.

## Data Model Highlights
- **Admin**: username/password (argon2); JWT used for admin routes.
- **Facility**: `facilityId` (UUID), notification emails, timezone, status.
- **QRCode**: entry/exit tokens with validity window and scan counters.
- **Device**: device metadata, visitorId, push token, `currentFacility`.
- **Enrollment**: one-per-device record; stores entry/exit QR refs, status, timestamps.

## Deployment Notes
- `dailyQRService` schedules QR rotation using `DAILY_QR_CRON` and `DAILY_QR_TZ`.
- Static assets served from `/uploads`.
- Helmet, CORS (from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`), and morgan logging enabled globally.
